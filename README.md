# SOEN342-Project-2025
The repository for our SOEN 342: Software Requirements and Deployment course project.  
The system aims to support an organization offering their clients group  
and private lessons.  

Please note that we specify an offering (no instructor), a lesson (an offering with an instructor and now available to the users) and  
a booking (lesson booked by a client)
